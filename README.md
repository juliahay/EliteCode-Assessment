# Elite Code Assessment
For Elite Code's Frontend Developer Internship, they asked that I design and code a small multiple choice application that can be used  to test users on coding concepts. This repository contains the code for the application I made. I use React Native to code the application and Expo to run it. See the instructions below for how to run the application yourself.

## How to Run the Application
- Download this code
- Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer. You can download that [here](https://nodejs.org/en)
- The easiest way to run this application is through using the Expo Go app on your phone. 
    - Download Expo Go onto your device.
- Navigate into the folder containing the code and run `npx expo start`
- Once the code loads, a QR code will appear. Scan this QR code with your device and it should navigate you to the Expo Go app to run the application. You might need to create an Expo account for everything to run. 
- To stop running the application, run `Ctrl+C` in the terminal
